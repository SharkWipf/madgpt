                <h4>Hey there, before you click away:</h4>
                <p>Just a quick heads up on why we (VFIO Discord) might sound a little tired when it comes to supporting single-GPU passthrough. Don't worry, no hard feelings, we just want to let you in on the challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zero* Benefit Over Dual-booting:</strong> For most use cases, single-GPU passthrough doesn't provide any tangible advantages over a good ol' dual boot setup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Same Issues, Over and Over:</strong> Most of the time, we're seeing the same common issues. And while we don't mind helping, it can become repetitive, like watching the same movie on repeat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad Guides:</strong> Unfortunately, there's an overabundance of flawed guides on the internet that many folks follow, leading to the aforementioned issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>There are better support Discords for single-GPU:</strong> The guides you find usually have their own support channels for it, especially if the guide comes from a youtuber. Go there instead. They actively support this use case.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Drain:</strong> Every day, there's less people actually willing to provide support. The regulars increasingly ignore the support channels as it's all the same thankless issues on the same pointless setups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Factually incorrect reasons:</strong> A lot of people think it solves a problem where it doesn't, like "I don't trust Windows" or "I don't want to allocate the disk space". VFIO changes nothing here.</li>
                    <li><strong>Just For The Sake Of It:</strong> Many users try single-GPU passthrough just because someone (usually a youtuber) said it's cool, without actually knowing why. We love curiosity, but it can be taxing when it turns into a support request.</li>
                    <li><strong>A lot of the time, it's for cheating:</strong> Cheaters regularly come in here demanding help with some thinly veiled lie about what they're actually try to do. The worst and most draining kinds of people.</li>
                    <li><strong>A more in-depth, more comprehensive list can be found <a href="/FAQ">here</a>.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember, we're all here volunteering our time and knowledge. If you're considering single-GPU passthrough, please double-check your reasons, do some in-depth research, and who knows, maybe you'll be the one helping us out next time!</p>
                <p><strong>If you still insist on doing single-GPU passthrough, please <a href=/common-issues>check this page first</a>. It contains solutions to the majority of the single-GPU problems we see.</strong></p>
                <p>Thanks for your understanding! Let's continue making this a fun and rewarding place for all.</p>

        <p>This application is intended to be an exaggerated, but ultimately truthful way to express our frustrations at the stuff we get exposed to daily.<br/>
        Our support channels keep getting drained from actual support the more they get flooded with the same few single-GPU issues from the same bad guides over and over again, while the setup doesn't even make sense to begin with.</p>
