## Human-written readme

This project is pretty trash. I put no effort into the code at all, in fact, I just typed prompts into ChatGPT until something stuck.  
Do not take this project as an example of good code practice, and do not base your projects on this one if you want them to be sane.  
This project does not even have protections against API budget draining, aside from caching identical responses (and not even case insensitive).

A better design would be to move all PHP files except backend.php out of the webroot.  
The OpenAI "API" class is also pointlessly custom, there exist off-the-shelf PHP classes for the OpenAI API.

We're also including all of Bootstrap just to generate a fancy text box.

Do not take the wrong lessons from this project just because it seems to work.  
Also please do not think I do not know how to code properly because of this project, I just didn't care enough to bother for this project.


This project is an in-joke for the VFIO community on Discord.
It is not meant to be taken too seriously.
Also, the prompt is harsh. While mostly true, it does not necessarily entirely exactly reflect my views, it was made extra harsh in order to make ChatGPT extra mad.
It worked wonders. Proper MadGPT.
